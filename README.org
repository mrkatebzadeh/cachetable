# mica-rs

`mica-rs` is a Rust port of the Mica project (https://github.com/efficient/mica), a high-performance, distributed key-value store designed for low-latency workloads.
This crate reimplements the core functionality of Mica, excluding the network component.

The network layer (communication between nodes) is not implemented in this port yet.

## Usage

To include `mica-rs` in your project, add it to your `Cargo.toml` from the GitHub repository:

```toml
[dependencies]
mica-rs = { git = "https://github.com/mrkatebzadeh/mica-rs.git" }
```

## TODO
- [ ] Implement retrieval of a key-value pair from the store.
- [ ] Implement network communication for distributed key-value retrieval and storage.
